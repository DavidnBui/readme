##Package Summary 
  1. matplotlib is a python package that takes numerical values and creates a visual diagram for the user. The user can add labels, legends, specific values, and more. You can also create sever charts from bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots 

###Installation and Run Instructions
    1. Download and install matplotlib
    2. Open visual studio code and open code 
    3. When debugging a new window should pop up showing a visual representation of the code
    
####Code
    1. My specific code calculates covid cases every month and how many deaths occur over each month
    2. The month input is simply a placeholder for the x value and each number represents a month in the year 
    3. The y value is a numercial value that represents how many deaths can occur over the year 
    4. plt.plot creates the plot with the information from month and cases, as well as, the legend labeled "deaths" 
    5. The next 3 lines of code simply give names for the x axis, y axis and a title 
    6. The loop states how many people have caught the virus but have not passed away from it 
    7. The last line creates a visual presentation 
    
#####Future Idea 
     1. For a future idea I want to create something that uses this package, as well as, another package. For example I would want to use beautiful soup or nltk to gather statistics from websites and to create a graph with matplotlib.
